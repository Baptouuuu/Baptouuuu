### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french software engineer interested by functional programming, formal methods, graphs and all the knowledge surrounding human consciousness.

#### Open Source

Most of my open source work is done in the [Innmind](https://github.com/innmind) and [Formal](https://github.com/formal-php) organizations. It initially started as a few projects to crawl and index the web, but now it contains many tools to help my workflows and libraries to build higher and higher abstractions.

The best example for such _high_ abstraction library is [`innmind/operating-system`](https://github.com/Innmind/OperatingSystem).

#### Sharing

Most of the content I share is done on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/baptouuuu).

From time to time I give talks at conferences or local meetups; you can find all the slides, code and recordings [here](https://baptouuuu.github.io/talks/) (mix of french and english).

Occasionally I venture in recording videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Baptouuuu/featured).

I may sometime write articles (very rare), when I do it's either [here](https://github.com/Innmind/Research-N-Development) or [there](https://github.com/Baptouuuu/blog).
